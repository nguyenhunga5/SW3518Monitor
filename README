# SW3518 Monitor Project

## Overview

This project is designed to monitor and control the SW3518 fast charger chip using an Arduino. The system includes an OLED display for visual feedback and an I2C interface for communication with the SW3518 chip.

## Features

- Monitor charging voltage, current, and power.
- Display fast charge protocol and temperature.
- Control and configure the SW3518 chip via I2C.
- Web-based interface for remote monitoring and control.
- Emoticon editor for customizing display graphics.
